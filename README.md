ANZx HackerRank 100% solution, clean code was not a consideration.

Two empty functions are provided by HackerRank to be completed:

1. tracesAreSimilar
2. countingUniversalSubarrays

## Requirements:

### Traces Are Similar
TBD

### Counting Universal Subarrays
You will be given an array comprised of '2's or '4's. A subarray  (A subarray is a group of contiguous elements in an array and cannot be empty)  of such an array is called "universal" if it matches the following conditions:

The 2's and 4's are grouped consecutively (eg, `[4, 2]`,`[2, 4]`,`[4, 4, 2, 2]`,`[2, 2, 4, 4]`,`[4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]`, etc.).
The number of 4's in the subarray is equal to the number of 2's in the subarray.
Subarrays with the same element but different positions are treated differently. For example, there are two `[4, 2]` subarrays in array `[4, 2, 4, 2]`.
You need to return an integer value, the number of "universal" subarrays in a given array.
